A way to comment on a suggestion.

A view is going to be an HTML file, and we can feed into it a list of suggestions from a controller.
To input suggestions, we will need to write a form that updates the model of our app. It will update it using a controller, since the controller is the middle-man between the view and the model.
To upvote a suggestion, we can add a button that changes the amount of upvotes a specific suggestion has in the model.
To comment on a suggestion, we will need to add routing to add another view. We can use similar ideas as above to build out the comments functionality.
